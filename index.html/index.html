        Hello everyone, my name is Goke-aina Sagoe, a software engineer and a
        future problem solver using technology. <br />I want to make things easy
        for humans, also create more job opportunities for a person that has no
        knowledge of science.<br />I would love to a lot of amazing things.

        Lagos, state, southwestern Nigeria, on the coast of the Bight of Benin.
        It is bounded by the state of Ogun to the north and east, by the Bight
        of Benin to the south, and by the Republic of Benin to the west. From
        1914 to 1954 the area included in the state was administered by the
        British as part of the colony of Nigeria. The provisions of the 1954
        constitution led to the creation of the Federal Territory of Lagos (the
        27-square-mile [70-square-km] area of Lagos Island, including the city
        of Lagos) and to the transfer of the city‚Äôs hinterland to the
        administrative region of Western Nigeria. This arrangement restricted
        the expansion of Lagos city onto the mainland, however, and in 1967 the
        creation of Lagos state by the national government restored to the city
        sovereignty over its hinterland.
